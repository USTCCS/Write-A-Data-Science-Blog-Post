## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand: **How to get a higher salary?**

1. What kind of software developer should I be?
2. Which program language and should I learn?
3. Should I get a higher degreeï¼Ÿ

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@realYinChen/as-a-programmer-how-to-get-higher-salary-c4851a56c3f9).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
